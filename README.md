# Quake log parser

Project to parse the Quake log file

![quake log parser pipeline](https://github.com/littlejuh/quake-log-parser/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml/badge.svg)

## Context
A log file was generated by a Quake 3 Arena server. This project implements the following functionalities:

- Read the log file
- Group the game data of each match
- Collect kill data
- Generate output report

Example of generate output game report: 
```json
"game_1": {
"total_kills": 45,
"players": ["Dono da bola", "Isgalamido", "Zeh"],
"kills": {
  "Dono da bola": 5,
  "Isgalamido": 18,
  "Zeh": 20
  }
}
```
### Business assumptions
- Games without players returns players as empty array, like []
- Kills score per player in game never bellow zero  
- Report per game only return kills by means that happened
